##### (c) The anti-money laundering program shall include a written anti-money laundering policy reviewed and approved by the Licensee's board of directors or equivalent governing body.

##### (d) Each Licensee, as part of its anti-money laundering program, shall maintain records and make reports in the manner set forth below.

2. Reports on transactions. When a Licensee is involved in a transaction or series of transactions for the receipt, exchange, conversion, purchase, sale, transfer, or transmission of Virtual Currency, in an aggregate amount exceeding the United States dollar value of $10,000 in one day, by one Person, the Licensee shall notify the Department, in a manner prescribed by the superintendent, within 24 hours.

3. Reporting of Suspicious Activity. Each Licensee shall monitor for transactions that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other illegal or criminal activity and notify the Department, in a manner prescribed by the superintendent, immediately upon detection of such a transaction(s).

    1. Each Licensee shall file Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”) in accordance with applicable federal laws, rules, and regulations.

    2. Each Licensee that is not required to file SARs under federal law shall file with the superintendent, in a form prescribed by the superintendent, reports of transactions that indicate a possible violation of law or regulation within 30 days from the detection of the facts that constitute a need for filing. Continuing suspicious activity shall be reviewed on an ongoing basis and a suspicious activity report shall be filed within 120 days of the last filing describing continuing activity.

##### (e) No Licensee shall structure transactions, or assist in the structuring of transactions, to evade reporting requirements under this Part.

##### (f) No Licensee shall engage in, facilitate, or knowingly allow the transfer or transmission of Virtual Currency when such action will obfuscate the identity of an individual customer or counterparty. Nothing in this Section, however, shall be construed to require a Licensee to make available to the general public the fact or nature of the movement of Virtual Currency by individual customers or counterparties.

##### (g) Each Licensee shall also maintain, as part of its anti-money laundering program, a customer identification program.

1. Identification and verification of account holders. When opening an account for a customer, each Licensee must, at a minimum, verify the customer’s identity, to the extent reasonable and practicable, maintain records of the information used to verify such identity, including name, physical address, and other identifying information, and check customers against the Specially Designated Nationals (“SDNs”) list maintained by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”), a part of the U.S. Treasury Department. Enhanced due diligence may be required based on additional factors, such as for high risk customers, high-volume accounts, or accounts on which a suspicious activity report has been filed.
